# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in UltraLocked’s security. This project is maintained by a small team and does not currently have a formal audit or bug bounty program — but we take security seriously and welcome responsible reports.

## 🔍 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability or potential issue, please report it privately by email:

- **Email:** security@lab1908.com

Please do **not** file GitHub issues for sensitive security problems.

## ⛳ Scope

This project is closed-source. This repository only contains documentation and a public white paper. Security reports are especially appreciated for:

- Inconsistencies or omissions in documented security guarantees
- Bypass of documented failsafes (duress codes, vault wipes, etc.)
- Potential cryptographic design flaws
- Forensic or side-channel weaknesses not already covered in the white paper

## 📝 Disclosure Policy

If an issue is confirmed, we will publish a plain-English disclosure (with your permission) in this repo once a fix or mitigation is in place.

We currently do not offer a bug bounty — but your contribution will be acknowledged if you'd like.
